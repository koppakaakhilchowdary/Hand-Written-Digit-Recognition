# Object Detection in Real-Time Videos

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time object detection system** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** architecture integrated with **Python** and **OpenCV**. The system is capable of detecting and labeling multiple objects simultaneously in live video streams, achieving both **speed** and **accuracy** suitable for practical applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a robust object detection pipeline for real-time video analysis.
- Leverage **YOLO** for high-performance detection across multiple object classes.
- Integrate with **OpenCV** to process live video streams and display results dynamically.
- Ensure scalability for potential deployment in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and automation systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** OpenCV, YOLO (Darknet/YOLOv3/YOLOv5 depending on implementation), NumPy  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for development and testing
